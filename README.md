# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this effort was to create a website with a dynamic table to allow users to filter data pertaining to UFO sightings based on date, city, state, country, and/or shape.
## Results
With provided data, I constructed a webpage and a table which lists the given data related to UFO sightings using both HTML and JavaScript.
### Search Criteria
I created user input boxes to select search criteria with placeholder values to be used as sample entry:

### Search Results
Once the user enters the search, the system displays a table with the filtered data:
For example - City = el cajon and shape = light:

## Summary
In summary, the website created can be easily used to narrow data down by a user when researching UFO sightings.
### Possible Improvements
Some of the improvements I would like to make to my webestie would be to align the Filter Search boxes for better visual appearance.  I would also prefer a different font color for the placeholder text to better differentiate user entered values from the placeholder values.
